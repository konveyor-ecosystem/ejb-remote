# EJB Remote
Sample migration of a Java EE app migrated to Quarkus.
This was originally from the JBoss EAP Quickstarts and we broke it out to it's own repo to ease testing

## Branches
* 'main' - Represents the Java EE code from https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/tree/7.4.x/ejb-remote
* 'quarkus' - Represents same app that has been migrated to Quarkus as per: https://github.com/christophermay07/quarkus-migrations/tree/main/ejb-remote-to-quarkus-rest
